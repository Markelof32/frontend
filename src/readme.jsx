                Hey. We all have been in the long ATM lines. Be it for deposition or withdrawal of cash.<br />
                What if I match the people that want to deposit cash with the people that want to withdraw cash?<br /><br />
                1. Register and login. Enter the amount that you want to exchange.<br />
                2. Choose if you want to exchange cash or digital currency. The app will give you some matches. They are looking to exchange with you: cash to digital or digital to cash.<br />
                3. Choose the closest person from the matches. Just click their name to send them a chat request.<br />
                4. Similarly, other users can send you chat requests, and you can accept them.<br />
                5. You can check the users that accepted your request in the chats section. Just click their name and start chatting.<br />
                6. Go back to the matches and choose another user if you want to chat with a new user.<br />
